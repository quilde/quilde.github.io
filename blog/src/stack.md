# Building a blog

When I set out to make my blog I wanted it to be:

- fast
- beautiful
- Markdown
- small
- still be able to do scripting
- no or fast builds

# Failed attempts and alternatives investigated

Especially the fast builds one was important.
I remember trying to get Leptos to build with GH Pages and it was a disaster: https://github.com/quilde/quilde.github.io/commits/main/?since=2024-01-29&until=2024-02-08

At first I thought about using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as everyone seems to be using that.

> [!NOTE] Jekyll requires the following:
    - Ruby version 2.5.0 or higher
    - RubyGems
    - GCC and Make

yeah, no.

Although it seems that GH Pages uses Jekyll now by default, as I had to add a `.nojekyll` file.

# zero-md

At first I used [Zero-md](https://github.com/zerodevx/zero-md). The idea is simple: write your stuff as Markdown, zero-md takes it and produces html elements from it. It's very easy to get started with and surprisingly fast.

However I realized we can do better in a easy and satisfying way.

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) seems interesting, but too much of a hassle, I think.

# Current setup ‚öôÔ∏è

The build system ensures that there is no lag because the page needs to compile on the fly and I get to use all the fancy features.

## Build system

This is the full thing:

## Marked üîñ

Instead of using it via zero-md I use [marked-js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) directly to compile my posts.

### Marked plugins üîå

- [marked-alert](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked-alert) üö®
- [marked-highlight](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked-highlight) üë®‚Äçüíª

> [!TIP] With marked-alert we get these fancy callouts!

> [!DANGER] We can even make custom ones!

## Gray-matter ü©∂

I use [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) to parse the yaml frontmatter of my markdown files.

```yaml
---
styles: 
  - id.css
title: "Indexdiachronica"
description: foo bar baz
---
```
Here I can for example include post-specific css files.

## Xml-Js üì¨

I use [xml-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml-js) to construct the rss feed for the page. I don't know whether that works yet.

## Arrow-js üèπ

All the components are written using [arrow-js](https://www.arrow-js.com/). It's not your typical JS UI framework: It's very minimal and powerful.

## OKLCH üñåÔ∏è
The oklch colorspace is amazing. 
I love systems that map closely to how we think and let you express your ideas very precisely.
Suddenly, these numbers have meaning.

- [oklch color picker](https://oklch.com/#70,0.1,358,100)
- [interactive blog post](https://abhisaha.com/blog/interactive-post-oklch-color-space)

## Other 

I'm using [Motion](https://github.com/motiondivision/motion) for my animations.
Unfortunately it's a bit more complicated if you're not using React.

[Lucide](lucide.dev) for icons

# the Future üîÆ
- tags
- actually get the post list working
